<h1 style="text-align:center;margin-bottom:20px"> THE THREE LITTLE PIGS </h1>
<p style="text-align:justify;font-family:Arial;font-size:155%;margin-left:550px;margin-right:60px;margin-bottom:20px;"> Three little pigs set off into the real world to find their fortune. After they all go off, they all meet a man with either straw, furze (sticks), or bricks. The first pig builds his house out straw, and the wolf comes along asking him to let him in. The pig says no, and the wolf blows down the house and eats the pig. The second pigs builds his house out of furze, which are sticks, and just like the first pig, the wolf comes along asking him to open his door. When the pig declines the wolf blows down the house and eats the pig. Finally the wolf goes to the third pigs house and again asks if he can go inside, but when the pig says no, the wolf tries to blow down the house. When he fails he asks the pig if he wants to go to a field of turnips in the morning at a certain time. The pig agrees, but in the morning he goes to the field an hour earlier than planned. When the wolf realizes what he has done, he asks the pig to go somewhere in the morning again at a certain time. This happens two more times before the wolf tries to go down the chimney, where the pig has a boiling pot of water hanging over a fire. The wolf drops into it </p>

<h1 style="text-align:center;margin-bottom:20px"> THE TORTOISE AND THE HARE </h1>
<p style="text-align:justify;font-family:Arial;font-size:155%;margin-left:550px;margin-right:60px;margin-bottom:20px;"> A hare was making fun of a tortoise for moving so slow. The tortoise, tiring of the hare’s gibes about how slow he was on his feet, eventually challenged the hare to a race. ‘I’ll race you, hare,’ he said; ‘and I bet I’ll win the race.’
<Br>
<Br>
The hare agreed to this challenge, and a fox was found who set the course of the race and to judge who had won at the end.
<Br>
<Br>
When the race started, the hare bounded off in front, making good progress. He was so far ahead of the tortoise that he decided he could afford to stop and have a rest. The tortoise was so far behind that a little rest wouldn’t hurt!
<Br>
<Br>
However, the hare fell fast asleep, and as he lay sleeping, the tortoise continued to plod along at his slow pace. In time, he reached the finish-line and won the race.
<Br>
</Br>
When the hare woke up, he was annoyed at himself for falling asleep. So he ran off towards the finish-line as fast as his legs would carry him, but it was too late, as the tortoise had already won. </p>

In the end, the ugly duckling matured into a beautiful swan, and he never imagined that he can be loved by everyone when he was an ugly duckling </p>
