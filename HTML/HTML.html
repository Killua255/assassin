<h1 style="background-color:DodgerBlue;text-align:center;">Hello World</h1>
<p style="background-color:LightGray;">Greetings, wondrous world of mine
<br> 
I hope that you are doing fine
<br> 
I know I'm not, but that's okay
<br> 
That's not why I write today
<br> 
I'd like to speak of those less known
<br> 
Your tenants feel that they're alone
<br> 
They struggle through the day and night
<br> 
They may lose, although they fight
<br> 
But still you turn and turn and turn
<br>
A blinded eye, with no concern
<br> 
If you work to save my friends
<br>
You and I can make amends
<br>
I know that you can set them free
<br>
And so, for now: with love, signed me</p>
